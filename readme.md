**"Just a bot for fun..."**

Nothing wrong with a little bot to liven things up on the server right?
This bot was made to have a little fun on Discord.
Also to let me learn some python lol

Just follow the directions, run the lnk file, make sure you have python 3.6.3 installed, and you're good to go!
